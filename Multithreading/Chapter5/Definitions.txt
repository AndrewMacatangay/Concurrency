Easy to code:
    Sequentially consistent - Every thread is updated about the changes made to memory (expensive)
    Relaxed - Read/Writes to memory can happen in any order (cheap)
Hard to code:
    Acquire/Release - All writes must happen before the release barrier and after the acquire barrier (Some overhead)
